# ZilMate Engineering Update - May 2024

## Summary

This update transforms ZilMate into a production-grade "Super Agent" by introducing high-utility autonomous capabilities, modernizing the SDK architecture, and implementing identified strategic improvements.

### Features Added
*   **Production-Grade Browser Automation:** Full-featured web automation using Playwright.
*   **Image Intelligence:** Professional background removal for images.
*   **Cost & Token Observability:** Real-time session tracking of model usage and costs.
*   **Proactive System Diagnostics:** Background dependency checking for external tools.
*   **Modular Prompt System:** Dynamic instruction injection for optimized token usage.

### Tools Added
*   `browserNavigate`, `browserClick`, `browserType`, `browserExtractContent`, `browserTakeScreenshot`, `browserExecuteScript`.
*   `removeBackground` (Professional foreground extraction).
*   `checkDependency` (Proactive doctor check helper).

### SDK & Architectural Improvements
*   **Tool Registry:** Centralized registration and grouping of tools.
*   **Standardized Tool Definition:** `defineTool` helper for unified execution, error handling, and telemetry.
*   **Agent Telemetry:** Trace-level observability for agent and tool lifecycle events.
*   **Unified Storage:** Abstraction layer for local and cloud (Redis) persistence.
*   **Enhanced Confirmation UX:** Support for "session-level" toolkit approvals.

## Detailed Changes

### Browser Automation
*   **Purpose:** Enable autonomous multi-step web workflows.
*   **Design:** Built on Playwright (Chromium) for high reliability. Supports visual reasoning via screenshots and direct DOM interaction.
*   **Files:** `src/tools/browser.tool.ts`.
*   **Usage:** "Navigate to the ZiloShift admin portal and extract the latest verification stats."

### Image Intelligence (rembg)
*   **Purpose:** Professional asset preparation and background removal.
*   **Design:** Uses the industry-standard `rembg` Python library for high-quality edge detection.
*   **Files:** `src/tools/image-intelligence.tool.ts`.
*   **Usage:** "Remove the background from this worker profile photo and save as PNG."

### SDK Modernization
*   **Purpose:** Improve developer experience and system maintainability.
*   **Design:** Decoupled tool logic from agent orchestration using a `ToolRegistry`. Standardized the execution loop with `defineTool` to ensure consistent progress reporting and error handling.
*   **Files:** `src/runtime/registry.ts`, `src/runtime/tool-utils.ts`, `src/runtime/telemetry.ts`.

## Remaining Opportunities

*   **Managed Cloud Workers:** Transition from local terminal persistence to 24/7 cloud workers.
*   **Granular RBAC:** Implementation of the role-based access control blueprint for tools.
*   **Vector Documentation RAG:** Migrating local Zilo docs to a vector database for semantic search.
*   **Visual Trace Dashboard:** A web-based UI for the new Telemetry module to visualize agent thought graphs.

## Validation

### Verification Performed
*   **Full Build:** Successfully ran `npm run build` with zero type errors.
*   **Dependency Install:** Verified installation of Playwright and rembg in the sandbox.
*   **Prompt Integration:** Verified that the Manager agent correctly receives the new browser and image instructions.
*   **Modular Logic:** Verified the `SystemPromptBuilder` correctly assembles instructions from multiple sections.

### Risk Areas
*   **Browser Isolation:** While effective, browser automation increases the attack surface for prompt injection.
*   **System Dependencies:** Tools like `rembg` require Python and specific libraries on the host system.
